full credit to AndrejPHP for the original sql file.

to produce the same visuals as I did in the Jupyter notebook, please use these steps:
either:

1. download the w3_after_koji.sql script file, run in your own schema. it will create all tables, values and stored procedures.	
2. boot up w3_mysql.ipynb and run.

or:

1. download the original sql script file from AndrejPHP: https://github.com/AndrejPHP/w3schools-database, create in your own schema
2. create the city_points table (also found in w3_after_koji.sql), with subsequent stored procedures
3. run w3_get_points.ipynb, insert into the city_points 
4. boot up w3_mysql.ipynb and run.
